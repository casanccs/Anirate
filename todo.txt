One of the hardest parts: The Notification System

Current idea:

1. Global timer in front-end using React-Native (Done)
2. Once timer sets off, send a request to Backend with jwt_authorization.
3. Flask gets the request, gets the user with that specific jwt_authorization.
4. Runs the recent() and signal() function (Move both of the functions into a single view)
5. At the end of the signal function, it will return a response back to client which will indicate if they should receieve the notfication or not.

This worked!!! ^^ 


But now there is a new issue:

When Flask gets the request and checks for the recent anime, it grabs the newest episodes and only signals IF there is a change from the
    NEW "Anirate.json" and its "Anime" model. But once that person is finished, the "Anime" model is already changed. Instead what should happen.
A potential fix for that could be:
1. Do NOT commit the database with the change.
2. The person who gets onto the website will get a request, but make sure only when they enter the website for the first time it occurs.
    This makes it so that other people will be able to get signaled with the data.
3. At 11am, "Anirate.json" will finally update the Anime database and commit the changes.
