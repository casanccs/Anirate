One of the hardest parts: The Notification System

Current idea:

1. Global timer in front-end using React-Native
2. Once timer sets off, send a request to Backend with jwt_authorization.
3. Flask gets the request, gets the user with that specific jwt_authorization.
4. Runs the recent() and signal() function (Move both of the functions into a single view)
5. At the end of the signal function, it will return a response back to client which will indicate if they should receieve the notfication or not.
